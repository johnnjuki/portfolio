Hi there! I'm John Njuki. I'm a web developer with a focus on front-end development.

I have a solid foundation in Javascript, TypeScript, CSS, Tailwind CSS, React, Next.js, and Prisma for database interaction, gained through hands-on experience and project-based learning. I have applied these skills in several projects, demonstrating my ability to create functional and aesthetically pleasing web applications. I'm continuously improving and expanding my skill set.
{/* I'm currently seeking an <u>internship</u> where I can apply my knowledge and contribute to solving real-world problems. If you have an opportunity that aligns with my skills, don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:johnnjuki.dev@gmail.com). */}
